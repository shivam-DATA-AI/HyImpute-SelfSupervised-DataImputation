# HyImpute: Hybrid Self-Supervised Data Imputation Framework

## Project Overview  
HyImpute is a hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed to intelligently impute missing data in structured datasets. It combines causal graph discovery, generative world modeling, and diffusion-based reconstruction to adaptively handle various missingness types (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) without requiring fully labeled data.

## What I Worked On  
- Implemented baseline and advanced imputation methods including mean, KNN, MICE, and a deep denoising autoencoder  
- Developed a self-supervised pipeline integrating causal discovery and diffusion models for data reconstruction  
- Designed feature engineering steps including age binning, interaction features, and target encoding  
- Evaluated imputation quality using RMSE and assessed downstream classification performance using Random Forest and XGBoost models  
- Performed hyperparameter tuning and balanced training with SMOTE  
- Applied dimensionality reduction using PCA and presented classification metrics including confusion matrices  

## Technologies and Tools Used  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, imbalanced-learn)  
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning-based imputation  
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations  
- Google Colab for interactive development and execution  

## Project Goals  
- Improve missing data imputation accuracy over traditional and deep learning baselines  
- Ensure robustness across different missingness patterns and domains (healthcare, finance, IoT)  
- Enable improved predictive performance in downstream machine learning tasks  

## Future Work  
- Extend the model for unstructured and time-series data with temporal causal inference  
- Integrate multi-modal datasets (images, text, sensor data) for unified imputation  
- Develop interpretability features to explain imputed values and model predictions  
- Explore adversarial robustness and active learning for handling challenging missingness scenarios  
- Optimize model for scalability and real-time applications
